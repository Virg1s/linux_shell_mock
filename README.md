# linux_shell_mock

A mock command line client for linux. 

Parses and launches commands given to it and can be found on path. 
Implements |, ||, &, &&, > operators.

Decide to take on this little pet project while trying to learn the C language.
It is still work in progress. Any feedback and citique would be appreciated.
