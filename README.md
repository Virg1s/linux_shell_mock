# linux shell mock

A mock command line client for linux. 

Parses and launches given commands that can be found on path.
Implements |, ||, &, &&, > operators.

Decide to take on this little pet project while trying to learn the C language.
It is still work in progress. Any feedback and citique would be highly appreciated.
